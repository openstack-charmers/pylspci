Contributions to the project are greatly appreciated.

Bugs and suggestions
--------------------

You may `submit an issue`_ to GitLab to warn of any bugs, ask for new features,
or ask any questions that are not answered in this documentation.

When reporting a bug, do not forget to put in your version of Python and your
version of *pylspci*. This will greatly help when troubleshooting, as most
errors often come from version incompatibilities.

Development
-----------

Setup
^^^^^

You will need a virtual envionment to work properly. `virtualenvwrapper`_ is
recommended::

   git clone https://gitlab.com/Lucidiot/pylspci
   cd pylspci
   mkvirtualenv -a . pylspci
   pip install -e .[dev]

This will clone the repository, create a virtual environment named
``pylspci``, then tell pip to let the package be editable (``-e``).
The ``[dev]`` suffix adds the extra requirements useful for development.

Linting
^^^^^^^

The source code follows the PEP 8 code style and performs CI checks using the
``flake8`` tool. To perform the same checks locally, run ``flake8`` on the root
directory of this repository.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation you are reading is generated by the `Sphinx`_ tool.
The text files that hold the documentation's contents are written in
`reStructuredText`_ and are available under the ``/docs`` folder of the
`GitLab repository`_.
They are also subject to linting using the ``doc8`` tool.
